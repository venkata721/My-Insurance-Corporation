					 Life insurance or life assurance, especially in the Commonwealth, is a contract between an insurance policy holder and an insurer or assurer, 
					  where the insurer promises to pay a designated beneficiary a sum of money (the benefit) in exchange for a premium, upon the death of an insured
					  person (often the policy holder).<br/>
					  Depending on the contract, other events such as terminal illness or critical illness can also trigger payment. 
					  The policy holder typically pays a premium, either regularly or as one lump sum. Other expenses (such as funeral expenses) can also be included in
					 the benefits. 
					  
					Life policies are legal contracts and the terms of the contract describe the limitations of the insured events. Specific exclusions are often written 
					into the contract to limit the liability of the insurer; common examples are claims relating to suicide, fraud, war, riot, and civil commotion.

					  <b ><h3> Types of Life Insurance Policies</h3></b>
					  <b>Whole life:</b> 
					  <br/>
					Whole-life policies, a type of permanent insurance, combine life coverage with an investment fund. Here, you're buying a policy that pays a stated,
					fixed amount on your death, and part of your premium goes toward building cash value from investments made by the insurance company.
					Cash value builds tax-deferred each year that you keep the policy, and you can borrow against the cash accumulation fund without being taxed. 
					The amount you pay usually doesn't change throughout the life of the policy.
						<br/>
					  <b>Universal life</b>	
						Universal life is a type of permanent insurance policy that combines term insurance with a money market-type investment that pays a market rate of 
						return. To get a higher return, these policies generally don't guarantee a certain rate.
						<br/>
						<b>Variable life</b>
						Variable life and variable universal life are permanent policies with an investment fund tied to a stock or bond mutual-fund investment. 
						Returns are not guaranteed.
						<br/>
						<b>Term life</b>
						A term policy is straight insurance with no investment component. You're buying life coverage that lasts for a set period of time provided 
						you pay the monthly premium. Annual-renewable term is purchased year-by-year, although you don't have to requalify by showing evidence of
						good health each year.
