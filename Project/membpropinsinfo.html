					Property insurance provides protection against most risks to property, such as fire, theft and some weather damage. This includes specialized 
					forms of insurance such as fire insurance, flood insurance, earthquake insurance, home insurance, or boiler insurance. Property is insured in 
					two main waysâ€”open perils and named perils. Open perils cover all the causes of loss not specifically excluded in the policy. Common 
					exclusions on open peril policies include damage resulting from earthquakes, floods, nuclear incidents, acts of terrorism, and war. 
					Named perils require the actual cause of loss to be listed in the policy for insurance to be provided. The more common named perils include
					such damage-causing events as fire, lightning, explosion, and theft.

					<b>History: </b><br/>
					An 18th-century fire insurance contract.Property insurance can be traced to the Great Fire of London, which in 1666 devoured more than 13,000 houses. 
					The devastating effects of the fire converted the development of insurance "from a matter of convenience into one of urgency, a change of opinion 
					reflected in Sir Christopher Wren's inclusion of a site for 'the Insurance Office' in his new plan for London in 1667".
					<br/>[1] A number of attempted fire insurance schemes came to nothing, but in 1681, economist Nicholas Barbon and eleven associates established 
					the first fire insurance company, the "Insurance Office for Houses", at the back of the Royal Exchange to insure brick and frame homes. 
					Initially, 5,000 homes were insured by Barbon's Insurance Office.
					'Fire insurance marks' to their customers; these would be displayed prominently above the main door to the property in order to aid positive identification. 
					One such notable company was the Hand in Hand Fire & Life Insurance Society, founded in 1696 at Tom's Coffee House in St. Martin's Lane in London.

				<b> Types of Coverage </b>
				There are the three types of insurance coverage. Replacement cost coverage pays the cost of repairing or replacing your property with like kind & 
				quality regardless of depreciation or appreciation. Premiums for this type of coverage are based on replacement cost values, and not based on actual 
				cash value. Actual cash value coverage provides for replacement cost minus depreciation. Extended replacement cost will pay over the coverage limit 
				if the costs for construction have increased. This generally will not exceed 25% of the limit.
