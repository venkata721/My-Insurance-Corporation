					Auto/ Vehicle insurance (also known as car insurance or motor insurance) is insurance purchased for cars, trucks, motorcycles, and other road vehicles. 
					 Its primary use is to provide financial protection against physical damage and/or bodily injury resulting from traffic collisions and against liability
					 that could also arise there from. The specific terms of vehicle insurance vary with legal regulations in each region. To a lesser degree vehicle insurance 
					 may additionally offer financial protection against theft of the vehicle and possibly damage to the vehicle, sustained from things other than traffic 
					 collisions.<br/>
					 <br/>
					 <b>History</b><br/>
					 Widespread use of the automobile began after the First World War in the cities. Cars were relatively fast and dangerous by that stage, yet there was 
					 still no compulsory form of car insurance anywhere in the world. This meant that injured victims would seldom get any compensation in an accident, and drivers
					 often faced considerable costs for damage to their car and property.
					 <br/>
					 A compulsory car insurance scheme was first introduced in the United Kingdom with the Road Traffic Act 1930. This ensured that all vehicle owners
					 and drivers had to be insured for their liability for injury or death to third parties whilst their vehicle was being used on a public road.[citation needed] 
					 Germany enacted similar legislation in 1939
					<br/>
					Vehicle insurance can cover some or all of the following items:<br/>
						1. The insured party (medical payments)<br/>
						2. Property damage caused by the insured<br/>
						3. The insured vehicle (physical damage)<br/>
						4. Third parties (car and people, property damage and bodily injury)<<br/>
						5. Third party, fire and theft<br/>
					</ol>
					In some jurisdictions coverage for injuries to persons riding in the insured vehicle is available without regard to fault in the auto accident 
					(No Fault Auto Insurance) The cost to rent a vehicle if yours is damaged.The cost to tow your vehicle to a repair facility.Accidents involving 
					uninsured motorists.  </p>
