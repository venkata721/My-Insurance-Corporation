					 Dental insurance is designed to pay a portion of the costs associated with dental care. There are several different types of individual, family, 
					 or group dental insurance plans grouped into three primary categories: (1) Indemnity (generally called: dental insurance) that allows you to see 
					 any dentist you want who accepts this type of coverage; (2) Preferred Provide Network dental plans (PPO); and (3) Dental Health Managed Organizations 
					 (DHMO) in which you are assigned or select an in-network dentist and/or in-network dental office and use the dental benefits in that network.
						<br/><br/>
						<b>Types of cover</b><br/>
						1. Indemnity Dental Insurance Plan: This plan may be helpful when you want to stay with your dentist and he/she does not participate
						in a dental network. By the very nature of this plan the insurance company generally pays the dentist a percentage of your services according to 
						the policy you purchased. In addition you will want to review the co-payment requirements, waiting periods, stated deductible, annual limitations, 
						graduated percentage scales based on the type of procedure and/or length of time you have owned the policy prior to starting your dental work.						
						<br/>
						2. Dental Health Maintenance Organization (DHMO): When a dentist signs a contract with a dental insurance company that provider agrees to accept an 
						insurance fee schedule and give their customers a reduced cost for services as an In-Network Provider. Many DHMO insurance plans have little or no 
						waiting periods, no annual maximum benefit  limitations, while covering major dental work near the start of the policy period. 
						This plan is sometimes purchased to help defray the high cost of the dental procedures.
						<br/>
						3. Participating Provider Network (PPO). Depending on your specific plan, the PPO works similar to a DHMO while using an In-Network facility.
						However, it allows you to use an Out-of-Network or Non-Participating Provider. Any difference of fees will become the financial responsibility
						of the patient unless otherwise specified in your dental policy.Thus, once the annual maximum benefit is exhausted any additional treatments may become the patient's responsibility. Each year that annual maximum 
						is reissued. The reissued date may vary as a calendar year, company fiscal year, or date of enrollment based on your specific plan.
