					 Health insurance is insurance against the risk of incurring medical expenses among individuals. By estimating the overall risk of health care and
					 health system expenses, among a targeted group, an insurer can develop a routine finance structure, such as a monthly premium or payroll tax, to ensure 
					 that money is available to pay for the health care benefits specified in the insurance agreement. The benefit is administered by a central organization 
					 such as a government agency, private business, or not-for-profit entity. 
					 According to the Health Insurance Association of America, health insurance is defined as "coverage that provides for the payments of benefits 
					 as a result of sickness or injury. Includes insurance for losses from accident, medical expense, disability, or accidental death and dismemberment"<br/>
					 <br/>
					  A health insurance policy is:
					  <br/>
					  
					1. A contract between an insurance provider (e.g. an insurance company or a government) and an individual or his/her sponsor 
					(e.g. an employer or a community organization). The contract can be renewable (e.g. annually, monthly)or lifelong in the case of private insurance, 
					or be mandatory for all citizens in the case of national plans. The type and amount of health care costs that will be covered by the health insurance 
					provider are specified in writing, in a member contract or "Evidence of Coverage" booklet for private insurance, or in a national health policy for 
					public insurance.<br/>
					<br/>
					2.Provided by an employer-sponsored self-funded ERISA plan. The company generally advertises that they have one of the big insurance 
					companies. However, in an ERISA case, that insurance company "doesn't engage in the act of insurance", they just administer it. Therefore, 
					ERISA plans are not subject to state laws. ERISA plans are governed by federal law under the jurisdiction of the US Department of Labor (USDOL).
					The specific benefits or coverage details are found in the Summary Plan Description (SPD). An appeal must go through the insurance company, then
					to the Employer's Plan Fiduciary. If still required, the Fiduciary's decision can be brought to the USDOL to review for ERISA compliance, and then 
					file a lawsuit in federal court.<br/>
